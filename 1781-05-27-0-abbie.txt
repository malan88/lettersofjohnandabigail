My dearest Friend



I have written so largely to you by Mr.

Storer who goes in the same vessel, that I should not have taken up my pen again, but in compliance with the request of a Friend whose partner is going abroad, and desires a Letter to you as an introduction.

Of Mr.

Dexter the Bearer I know nothing but his Name.

I have inclosed the Letter which I received from his partner who you know is a valuable Gentleman, and Eminent in his profession.



As Election is not passed I have nothing New to add.

My wishes for your Health and happiness and my anxiety to hear from you are an old Story.

Should I tender you my warmest affections, they are of a date, almost with my first knowledge of you, and near coeval with my existance, yet not the less valuable I hope to a Heart that know[s] not a change, but is unalterably the treasure of its ever affectionate



Portia

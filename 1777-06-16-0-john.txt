Philadelphia June 16 1777

I had a most charming Packett from you and my young Correspondents, to day.

I am very happy, to learn that you have done such great Things in the Way of paying Debts. I know not what would become of me, and mine, if I had not such a Friend to take Care of my Interests in my Absence.

You will have Patience with me this Time, I hope, for this Time will be the last.

I shall stay out this Year, if I can preserve my Health, and then come home, and bid farewell to great Affairs. I have a Right to spend the Remainder of my days in small ones.

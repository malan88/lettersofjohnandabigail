London March 7th 1788



my dear Friend



Not a word have I heard of, or from you Since you left me this day week.

I am anxious to know how you got over & how you do.

I am so unfortunate as to be confined for several days past with an inflamation in my Throat attended with canker, & some fever.

it is rather abated to day, and I hope is going of.

we go on packing, but it is a much more labourious peice of buisness than I imagind and takes much more time, I hope we shall finish in a few dayâ€™s The New dutch minister was presented at court this week & makes a splendid appearence with his footmen in scarelet & silver, & a gay page or Running footman was vastly well Received at Court &c &c



Nothing from America since you left us.



Master Billy is sitting upon the table whilst I write and send his duty to Grandpappa.

the Weather is such that I cannot but rejoice we are not at sea.

Scott has been beating in the Channel these ten days, but every day brings us a prospect of better weather.

adieu I shall be very uneasy if I do not hear from you by this Days post.

I know not where to direct to you so shall cover to Willinks.

ever yours



A Adams.

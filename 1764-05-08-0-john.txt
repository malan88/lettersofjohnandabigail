May 8th.  1764





Dr.  Diana



This Morning received yours by Mr.

Ayers.

I can say nothing to the Contents at present, being obliged to employ all my Time in preparing for Braintree.

I write only to thank you, and let you know I come home Tomorrow.

But when I shall see Diana, is uncertain.

In the Warfare between Inclination and Prudence, I believe Prudence must prevail, especially as that Virtue will in this Case be seconded by the sincerest of all Affections, that of Lysander for Diana.

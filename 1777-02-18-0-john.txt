Baltimore Feb.

18.

1777



I shall inclose with this a Newspaper or two.



I am as yet in tollerable Health.

My Eyes are somewhat troublesome.

I believe I must assume the Appearance of Wisdom, Age and Gravity and put on Spectacles to walk in, about the Streets.



I hear nothing from you, nor from any Part of New England, but I am endeavouring to devise some better Regulations of the Post Office, so that I hope that Channell of Communication will be opened.



We are told that the Air of Baltimore is unhealthy, and I confess I should dread it, if I were to stay here long.

But We shall soon remove.



You may write now by the Post.

I am very anxious to hear from you, and to know the State of public Affairs, in your Part of the World.



I have written by Mr.

Hall a Resignation of an Office.

I suppose it will make a Noise.

But I hope not much.

I cant help it.

But should be glad to hear from you, how it is received.

I hope they will fill it up soon, that the Talk may be soon over.



I could not be, at the same Time in Maryland and Massachusetts Bay, which was Reason enough for the Measure, if I had no other, but I have many more, and much stronger.



I have not Health enough, and never shall have to discharge such a Trust.

I can but just keep myself alive, and in tollerable Spirits when I am master of my own Time and Course of Life.

But this is not all.



I am not formal and ceremonious enough for such a stiff Situation.

But you know I have many Reasons more.

1777





We have promoted Arnold, one Step this day, for his Vigilance, Activity, and Bravery, in the late Affair at Connecticutt.

We shall make Huntingdon a Brigadier, I hope.



We shall sleep in a whole Skin for some Time I think in Philadelphia, at least untill a strong Reinforcement arrives.



I want to learn, where Sir William Erskine with his Two Thousand Men, went after his Exploit at Danbury.

Perhaps to Newport.

My dearest Friend



Mrs Smith appeard so anxious and unhappy tho She Said nothing, that seeing it, I advised her to follow you, & sent Michial to Town hoping she would overtake you tomorrow.

she appeard so



rejoiced at the proposal, that in half an hour, she was gone.

I hope She will overtake you by tomorrow night.



I slept well last night & tho I feel very low spirited, I shall strive to be [co]ntent.

I will follow you when I am able if you want me, but must leave it to future contingencies.

I congratulate you upon the News which is now thought Authentic of the Capture of the French Fleet by Nelson.

I inclose you some Letters received to day.

the contents of one of them will remain as tho it had never been seen by me—

I think it however, uncandid & severe forgive me that I opend it.

it was in hopes of finding a Letter from Brisler—

mr storer being here on his return to Hingham, I request him to address them and put them into the post office for you to be sent to N york.



Mr Cranch remains very sick indeed the dr says—

Love to William Shaw & to all who feel interested / in the happiness of your



A A

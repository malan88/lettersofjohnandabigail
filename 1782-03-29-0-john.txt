29 March 1782





My dearest Friend



The states of Holland and West Friesland have resolved, 28 March to admit Mr.  Adams to an Audience.



The inclosed Papers will shew what is going on here.  You will [hear?] much more of it.  I have yet no news of Charles’s Arrival.  John is well—&c.



British Ministry changed.

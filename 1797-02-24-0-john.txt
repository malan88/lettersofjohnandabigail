My dearest Friend



The Presbyterian Congregation have voted me the front Pew in their Church for my Family.

It is an elegant new Building and the Pew is large



I have bought me a Pair of Young Horses for a Carriage and a saddle horse.



The Birthday was affecting and the Night Splendid but tedious to those who were too old to dance.



I have now Settled all My Accounts with the senate as you will see by the inclosed Papers.



I assure you it was a tender Scene at parting.

How do you like our Adieus alias Farewells.

Nothing yet determined about House or Furniture.

Yours with a great desire to be with you, but it is impossible



John Adams

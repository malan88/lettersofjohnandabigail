My Dearest Friend



Altho I know not of a single opportunity by which I can convey to You my constant anxiety and solicitude for your Health; or obtain from you any knowledge of your present situation, yet I cannot refrain writing my sentiments upon the knowledge I have been able to obtain concerning you here.

There has been a motion in C[ongre]ss to recall all their M[inisters] and s[ecretaries] except at V[ersaille]s but it did not obtain.



I have been in daily expectation for months past, that Letters would arrive from you requesting leave to resign your employments; and return again to your Native Land, assured at least of finding one Friend in the Bosom of Portia, who is sick, sick of a world in which selfishness predominates, who is sick of counsels unstable as the wind, and of a servility to which she hopes your mind, will never bend.



Most sincerely can she unite with you in the wish of a sequestered Life, the shades of Virmont, the uncultivated Heath are preferable in her mind to the servility of a court.



Some writer observes “that censure is a tax that a Man pays the publick for being eminent.” It is in the power of every Man to preserve his probity; but no man living has it in his power to say that he can preserve his reputation.

Is it not in your power to withdraw yourself from a situation in which you are certain, no honour can be obtained to yourself or Country?

Why Letters have not reached America from you as well as from the minister at Versails, and Madrid since the extrodonary revocation of former powers, I cannot devine—

unless purposely stoped by Intrigues and Cabals.

The minister at Madrid has done himself and country Honour by refuseing to take a part in the New instructions.



What changes may have taken place in the cabinets abroad since the Capture of Cornwallis, we have not yet learnt.

If America does not improve it to her own advantage, she is deficient in that Spirit of Independance which has on former occasions distinguished her.



It is true that her Finances are rather in an unpleasent state.

Her Faith has been so often pledged, and having no stable funds, it has been so often forfeited to the undoing of those who confided most, that their is a distrust amongst her best Friends; C[ongres]s have not been able to obtain an impost of 5 per cent which was recommended to be laid upon the importation of all Foreign articles, salt and military stores excepted, for the purpose of raising a revenue to be at the sole disposal of C[ongre]ss.

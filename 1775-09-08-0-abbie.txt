Dearest Friend



Since you left me I have passed thro great distress both of Body and mind; and whether greater is to be my portion Heaven only knows.

You may remember Isaac was unwell when you went from home.

His Disorder increasd till a voilent Dysentery was the consequence of his complaints, there was no resting place in the House for his terible Groans.

He continued in this state near a week when his Disorder abated, and we have now hopes of his recovery.

Two days after he was sick, I was seaz’d with the same disorder in a voilent manner.

Had I known you was at Watertown I should have sent Bracket for you.

I sufferd greatly betwen my inclination to have you return, and my fear of sending least you should be a partaker of the common calamity.

After 3 day[s] an abatement of my disease relieved me from that anxiety.

The next person in the same week was Susy.

She we carried home, hope she will not be very bad.

Our Little Tommy was the next, and

he lies very ill now—there is no abatement at present of his disorder.

I hope he is not dangerous.

Yesterday Patty was seazd and took a puke.

Our House is an hospital in every part, and what with my own weakness and distress of mind for my family I have been unhappy enough.



And such is the distress of the neighbourhood that I can scarcly find a well person to assist me in looking after the sick.

Mrs.

Randle [Randall] has one child that is not expected to live out the night, Mrs.

Belcher has an other, Joseph Bracket an other, Deacon Adams has lost one, but is upon the recovery himself, and so are the rest of his family.

Mr.

Wibird lies bad.

Major Miller is dangerous.

Revd.

Mr.

Gay is not expected to live.



So sickly and so Mortal a time the oldest Man does not remember.

I am anxious for you.

Pray let me hear from you soon.

I thought you would have left me a Letter at Watertown as you staid so long there.

I was disapointed that you did not.

As to politicks I know nothing about them.

The distresses of my own family are so great that I have not thought about them.

I have wrote as much as I am able to, being very week.

I hope to add a more pleasing account er’er I close.

Adieu.

York Town November 3. 1777

My dearest Friend

This Moment I received your favour of Octr. 6. by Mr. Niles.—I am as well as can be expected.

We have no News, but such as is old to you.

I congratulate you on the great and glorious Events in the northern Department. Congress have ordered a Thanksgiving, and have done great Honour to the Officers.

We shall finish the Confederation in a few days.

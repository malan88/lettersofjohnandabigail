My dearest Friend



This Moment I received your favour of Octr.

by Mr.

Niles.

I am as well as can be expected.



We have no News, but such as is old to you.



I congratulate you on the great and glorious Events in the northern Department.

Congress have ordered a Thanksgiving, and have done great Honour to the Officers.



We shall finish the Confederation in a few days.

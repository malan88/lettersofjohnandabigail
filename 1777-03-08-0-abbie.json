    "We have had very severe weather almost ever since you left us.",

    "I do not remember to have seen the Roads so obstructed since my remembrance; there has been no passing since except for a Horse.",
    "I Have wrote you 3 Letters since your absence but whether you have ever received one of them I know not.",
    "The Post office has been in such a Situation that there has been no confiding in it, but I hear Hazard is come to put it upon a better footing.",
    "We know not what is passing with you nor with the Army, any more than if we lived with the Antipodes.  I want a Bird of passage.",
    "It has given me great pleasure to find by your Letters which I have received that your Spirits are so Good, and that your Health has not sufferd by your tedious journey.",
    "Posterity who are to reap the Blessings, will scarcly be able to conceive the Hardships and Sufferings of their Ancesstors.",
    "\u201cBut tis a day of suffering says the Author of the Crisis, and we ought to expect it.  What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through.",
    "If we get but Bread to eat and any kind of rayment to put on, we ought not only to be contented, but thankfull.",
    "What are the inconveniencies of a few Months or years to the Tributary bondage of ages?\u201d These are Sentiments which do Honour to Humane Nature.",
    "We have the Debates of Parliment by which it appears there are Many who apprehend a War inevitable and foresee the precipice upon which they stand.",
    "We have a report Here that Letters are come to Congress from administration, and proposals of a treaty, and some other Stories fit to amuse children, but Experienced Birds are not to be caught with chaff.",
    "What is said of the english nation by Hume in the Reign of Harry the 8th may very aptly be applied to them now, that they are so thoroughly subdued that like Eastern Slaves they are inclined to admire even those acts of tyranny and violence which are exercised over",
    "themselves at their own expence.",
    "Thus far I wrote when I received a Letter dated Febry.  10, favourd by \u2014 but it was a mistake it was not favourd by any body, and not being frank\u2019d cost me a Dollor.",
    "The Man who deliverd it to my unkle brought him a Letter at the same time for which he paid the same price.",
    "If it had containd half as much as I wanted to know I would not have grumbld, but you do not tell me How you do, nor what accommodations you have, which is of more consequence to me than all the discriptions of cities, states and kingdoms in the world.",
    "I wish the Men of War better imployd than in taking flower vessels since it creates a Temporary famine Here, if I would give a Guiney for a pound of flower I dont think I could purchase it.",

    "There is such a demand for Indian and Rye, that a Scarcity will soon take place in the Country.",
    "Tis now next to imposible to purchase a Bushel of Rye.  In short since the late act there is very little selling.",
    "The meat that is carried to market is miserabley poor, and so little of it that many people say they were as well supplied in the Seige.",

    "The Merchant and farmer are both alike.",

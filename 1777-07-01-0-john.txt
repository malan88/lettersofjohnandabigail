Philadelphia July 1.  1777



We have no News: a long, cold, raw, northeast Storm has chilled our Blood, for two days past.

It is unusual, to have a storm from that Point, in June and July.

It is an Omen no doubt.

Pray what can it mean?



I have so little Ingenuity, at interpreting the Auspices, that I am unable to say whether it bodes Evil to Howe, or to Us.



I rather think it augurs a fine Crop of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Corn, Spelts, Buckwheat, and Grass.

It is a Presage of Plenty.

Therefore let the Land rejoice.

Flax and Cotton will grow, the better for this Weather.

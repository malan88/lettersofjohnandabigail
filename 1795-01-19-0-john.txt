Philadelphia January 19.  1795



My dearest Friend



On Saturday I Saw our sons Letter to the Secretary of State.

Mr Randolph expressed his intire Satisfaction in it.

Said “it was a justification of the Propriety of his appointment, a Presage of his future Usefulness: and well digested, well arranged and well connected.” a handsome Compliment.



In this Letter he says Mr Jay had shewn him the whole Negotiation with Britain—

He Speaks very modestly and respectfully.

I may not repeat any Thing: but I learn from this Letter that there is not only a Possibility but some Probability that Mr Jay or at least The Result of his Negotiations may be here by the fourth of March.

If so I ought to be here too, which will derange my Plan of Spending thanksgiving with you.

This will afflect me: but What shall I do?



Charles and I are very happy for the Present but he returns on Thursday.

He sends his Love & Duty

Adieu

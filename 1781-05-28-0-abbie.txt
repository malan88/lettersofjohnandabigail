My Dearest Friend



I could not have conceived that a Letter written upon merely political subjects could have communicated so much pleasure to my Bosom as yours of the 28th of December to the president, of Congress, has given to mine.



This Letter was taken by the Enemy, carried into New York, and published by them, and republished [by] Edes.

For what reason the Enemy published it I cannot tell, as it contains nothing which can possibly [injure] us or the writer.

It has proved a cordial to my anxious Heart for by it I find you were then living, and in Amsterdam, two facts that I have not received under your own hand for 8 months.

This Letter is 3 months later than any which has reachd me.



Dr.

Dexter by whom I have before written, has since, been polite enough to visit me, that he might, as he expresses it, have the pleasure to tell you, that he had seen me, and take from me any verbal message, that I would not chuse to write, but my pen must be the faithfull confident of my Heart.

I could not say to a stranger, that which I could not write, nor dare I even trust to my pen the fullness of my Heart.

You must measure it, by the contents of your own when softned by recollection.



Dr.

Dexter appears to be a sensible well bred Gentleman, and will give you much information respecting our state affairs which may not be so prudent to commit to paper.

I have written to the House of de Neufvilla for a few articles by an other opportunity and have now inclosed a duplicate.



I intreat you my dearest Friend to forward Letters to the various ports in France as you have some acquaintance with many of them.

I should then be able to hear oftner.

    "If Col Hamiltons personal Dislike of Jefferson does not obtain too much Influence with Massachusetts Electors, neither Jefferson will be President nor Pinckney V.  P.  of U.S.",
    "I am not enough of an Englishman nor little enough of a French Man for some People.",
    "These would be very willing that Pinckney should come in, Chief.",
    "But they will be disappointed.",

    "He must be attended to and not Suffered to do too much."

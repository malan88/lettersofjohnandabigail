    "To Mark thy various full accomplish\u2019d mind\nTo mark that Spirit which, with British scorn\nRejects th Allurements of corrupted power;\nThat elegant politeness which excels,",
    "Even in the judgment of presumptuous France\nThe boasted manners of her shining court\nThat wit, the vivid energy of Sense\nThe truth of Nature, which with Attic point",
    "And kind well-temperd Satire, smoothly keen\nSteals through the Soul and without pain corrects.",
    "I think the Speculations you inclose prove that there is full Liberty of the press.",
    "Cato shews he has a bad cause to defend whilst the Forester writes with a spirit peculiar to himself and leads me to think that he has an intimate acquaintance with Common Sense.",

    "Just Heaven has given them to taste of the same cup of Afliction which they one year ago administerd with such Callous Hearts to thousands of their fellow citizen[s], but with this difference that they fly from their injured and enraged Country, whilst, pity and",
    "commiseration received the Sufferers whom they inhumanely drove from their Dwellings.",
    "I would fain hope that the time may not be far distant when those things you hint at may be carried into Execution.",
    "Oh are ye not those patriots, in whose power\nThat best, that Godlike Luxery is plac\u2019d\nOf blessing thousands, thousands yet unborn\nThro\u2019 late posterity?",
    "Ye large of Soul chear up dejected industery, and give A double Harvest to the pining Swain Teach thou the Labouring hand the Sweets of Toil How by the finest Art, the Native robe To weave; how white as hyperborean Snow To form the lucid lawn; with venturous oar How to",
    "dash wide the billow; nor look on Shamefully passive, while Brittania\u2019s Fleets Defraud us of the glittering finny Swarms That heave our friths, and swarm upon our Shores How all-enlivening trade to rouse, and wing The prosperous Sail, from every growing port uninjurd,",

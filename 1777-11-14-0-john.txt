Easton, at the Forks of Delaware in Pensylvania Novr.  14.  1777



Here I am.–I am bound home.–I suppose it will take me 14 days, perhaps 18 or 20, to reach Home.–Mr.  S.A.  is with me.–I am tolerably well.



The American Colours are still flying at Fort Mifflin.



The News on the other Side, is from a Merchant to his Partner.



I am in great Haste, most affectionately yours.

Monday Morning [15 August?] 1763



The Disappointment you mention was not intended, but quite accidental.

A Gentleman, for whom I had much Esteem, Mr.  Daniel Leonard of Norton, was so good as to offer to keep the sabbath with me at Braintreeâ€”a favour that would have been very agreable if it had not detained me from the most agreable of all Company, to me, in this world, and a favour that will I know be sufficient with you to excuse me.

A good Nights sleep I have had but not more than I should have had, for a Friend always keeps me awake till Midnight and after.



Shall return from Boston I hope time enough to obey, which I always do with more Pleasure than I ever command.



Yours,
J.  Adams

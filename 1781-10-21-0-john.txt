My dearest Friend



I have not yet seen the Work from whence the inclosed Extracts were made.

A set is on the Road, a Present from the Friend of Man, to me.

Meantime a Friend at a Distance who has a Set has sent me these Extracts.

They are worth printing in the Gazette, not to gratify the Vanity of an Individual so much as for the noble Testimony of a Character so much respected as that of Mr.

Hollis in favour of our Schools and System of Education.

I think too his sentiments that an Agent should stay but 3 years applicable to Congress Ministers, according to which Rule, my time is out.



I have great Occasion for a few of the New England shillings.

Pray send me, half a dozen if you can procure them by different Occasions.



With never ceasing affection, yours.

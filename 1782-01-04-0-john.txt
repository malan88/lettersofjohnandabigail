Amsterdam Jan. 4. 1782

My dearest Friend

I hope, Charles is at home by this time or that he will be in a few days. I presume he sailed from Bilbao in the Cicero, with M[ajor]Jackson and Mr. Trumbul, one of the first days of december yet I have no certain news of his sailing at all. John is well with Mr. D[ana] at Petersbourg.

I cannot tell you any News—there are great questions upon the Tapis here, but how they will be decided, I know not.—This Rep[ublic] is a Jilt. When you think you have her Affections, all at once you find you have been deceiv’d.

There is not so much as a Talk of a general Peace, nor is there any one who believes in a seperate Peace bet[ween] England and Holland.

Take Care of the War of Ports which the English talk of. Perhaps Falmouth, perhaps Rhode Island. Look to Privateers and trade.

Let not a Bow be unstrung. There will be, there can be no Peace.

I hope Hayden, who had some things for you, is arrived.

I shall not be able to send any thing more I am afraid untill next summer.

My Blessing to my Daughter and Son, my Duty to Parents and Affection to Brothers and Sisters.

Pray send me, half a dozen, N.E. shillings by different Opportunities, if you can find them.

Most affectionately Yours,

J.A.

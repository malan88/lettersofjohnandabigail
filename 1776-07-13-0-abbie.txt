Boston July 13 1776



I must begin with apoligising to you for not writing since the 17 of June.

I have really had so many cares upon my Hands and Mind, with a bad inflamation in my Eyes that I have not been able to write.

I now date from Boston where I yesterday arrived and was with all 4 of our Little ones innoculated for the small pox.

My unkle and Aunt were so kind as to send me an invitation with my family.

Mr.

Cranch and wife and family, My Sister Betsy and her Little Neice, Cotton Tufts and Mr.

Thaxter, a maid who has had the Distemper and my old Nurse compose our family.

A Boy too I should have added.

17 in all.

My unkles maid with his Little daughter and a Negro Man are here.

We had our Bedding &c.

to bring.

A Cow we have driven down from B[raintre]e and some Hay I have had put into the Stable, wood &c.

and we have really commenced housekeepers here.

The House was furnished with almost every article (except Beds) which we have free use of, and think ourselves much obliged by the fine accommodations and kind offer of our Friends.

All our necessary Stores we purchase jointly.

Our Little ones stood the opperation Manfully.

Dr.

Bulfinch is our Physician.

Such a Spirit of innoculation never before took place; the Town and every House in it, are as full as they can hold.

I believe there are not less than 30 persons from Braintree.

Mrs.

Quincy, Mrs.

Lincoln, Miss Betsy and Nancy are our near Neighbours.

God Grant that we may all go comfortably thro the Distemper, the phisick part is bad enough I know.

I knew your mind so perfectly upon the subject that I thought nothing, but our recovery would give you eaquel pleasure, and as to safety there was none.

The Soldiers innoculated privately, so did many of the inhabitants and the paper curency spread it everywhere.

I immediately determined to set myself about it, and get ready with my children.

I wish it was so you could have been with us, but I submit.



I received some Letters from you last Saturday Night 26 of June.

You mention a Letter of the 16 which I have never received, and I suppose must relate something to private affairs which I wrote about in May and sent by Harry.



As to News we have taken several fine prizes since I wrote you as you will see by the news papers.

The present Report is of Lord Hows comeing with unlimited powers.

However suppose it is so, I believe he little thinks of treating with us as independant States.

How can any person yet dreem of a settlement, accommodations &c.

They have neither the spirit nor feeling of Men, yet I see some who never were callâ€™d Tories, gratified with the Idea of Lord Hows being upon his passage with such powers.

    "April 6 1780",
    "My dear Portia",
    "There is a great deal of hatred against the Govt.  in England as you will see by the song inclosed.",
    "They are going on, with County meetings, Petitions, Committees, Correspondences, Associations &c.  in our mode.",
    "What it will come to, I dont know.",
    "They talk in London about withdrawing the Troops, &c., but I suspect, We had better take em, least they should alter their minds.",
    "At last a Vessell has arrived at Bourdeaux from Baltimore, brings two or three newspapers, as late as 17 feb.  but no Letters.",
    "You have had a hard Winter, but I hope you had a good fire.  I had a harder, without any fire, in Spain.",
    "I am so taken up, with writing to Phil[adelphia] that I dont write to you so often as I wish.",
    "I hope you wont complain of me this time for not writing often enough, and long enough whatever may be the worth of it.",
    "I hope you will advertise me, if there are any Machinations going forward.  All well.",
    "Adieu."

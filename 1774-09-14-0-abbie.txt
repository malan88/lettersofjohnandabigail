Dearest Friend



Five Weeks have past and not one line have I received.

I had rather give a dollar for a letter by the post, tho the consequence should be that I Eat but one meal a day for these 3 weeks to come.

Every one I see is inquiring after you and when did I hear.

All my intelligance is collected from the news paper and I can only reply that I saw by that, that you arrived such a day.

I know your fondness for writing and your inclination to let me hear from you by the first safe conveyance which makes me suspect that some Letter or other has miscaried, but I hope now you have arrived at Philidelphia you will find means to convey me some inteligance.



We are all well here.

I think I enjoy better Health than I have done these 2 years.

I have not been to Town since I parted with you there.

The Govenor is making all kinds of warlike preperations such as mounting cannon upon Beacon Hill, diging entrenchments upon the Neck, placeing cannon there, encamping a regiment there, throwing up Brest Works &c.

&c.

The people are much allarmed, and the Selectmen have waited upon him in concequence of it.

The county congress have also sent a committee—all which proceedings you will have a more particuliar account of than I am able to give you from the publick papers.

But as to the Movements of this Town perhaps you may not hear them from any other person.

In consequence of the powders being taken from Charlstown, a general alarm spread thro many Towns and was caught pretty soon here.

The report took here a fryday, and a Sunday a Soldier was seen lurking about the common.

Supposed to be a Spy, but most likely a Deserter.

However inteligence of it was communicated to the other parishes, and about 8 o clock a Sunday Evening there pass[ed] by here about 200 Men, preceeded by a horse cart, and marched down to the powder house from whence they took the powder and carried [it] into the other parish and there secreeted it.

I opened the window upon there return.

They pass’d without any Noise, not a word among them till they came against this house, when some of them perceiveing me, askd me if I wanted any powder.

I replied not since it was in so good hands.

The reason they gave for taking it, was that we had so many Tories here they dare not trust us with it.

They had taken Vinton in their Train, and upon their return they stoped between Cleverlys and Etters, and calld upon him to deliver two Warrents.

Upon his producing them, they put it to vote whether they should burn them and it pass’d in the affirmitive.

They then made a circle and burnt them,

they then call’d a vote whether they should huzza, but it being Sunday evening it passd in the negative.

They call’d upon Vinton to swear that he would never be instrumental in carrying into execution any of these new atcts.

They were not satisfied with his answers however they let him rest.

A few Days after upon his making some foolish speaches, they assembled to the amount of 2 and [3?] hundred, swore vengance upon him unless he took a solemn oath.

Accordingly, they chose a committee and sent [them] with him to Major Miller to see that he complied, and they waited his return, which proving satisfactory they disperced.

This Town appear as high as you can well immagine, and if necessary would soon be in arms.

Not a Tory but hides his head.

The church parson thought they were comeing after him, and run up garret they say, an other jumpt out of his window and hid among the corn whilst a third crept under his bord fence, and told his Beads.

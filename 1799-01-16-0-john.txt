My Dearest Friend

Yesterday, Tuesday when the Levee Room began to be thin Brisler came running in, with the delightful sounds “Sir, Mr Adams is up Stairs.” I was not long in mounting the escalier and had the high Pleasure of embracing my dear son Thomas after an Absence of

four years & an half.— We had a very happy Evening and he has had a good nights rest after the fatigues of his Voyage & Journey. He seems in good health & is very little Altered in stature, shape or Feature. His Mind is well stored with Ideas and his Conversation entertaining. This Evening he goes with me to the Ball. I had rather Spend it with him at home.

Inclosed is a beautiful Morcell from the Minister. Worth Gold.— It is the best elucidation of the Character of the K. of Prussia that I have ever seen.

Louisa I wish you were here to dance to night— I dont wish for your Aunt because One such Evening would kill her.

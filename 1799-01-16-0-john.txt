My Dearest Friend



Yesterday, Tuesday when the Levee Room began to be thin Brisler came running in, with the delightful sounds “Sir, Mr Adams is up Stairs.” I was not long in mounting the escalier and had the high Pleasure of embracing my dear son Thomas after an Absence of four years & an half.

We had a very happy Evening and he has had a good nights rest after the fatigues of his Voyage & Journey.

He seems in good health & is very little Altered in stature, shape or Feature.

His Mind is well stored with Ideas and his Conversation entertaining.

This Evening he goes with me to the Ball.

I had rather Spend it with him at home.



Inclosed is a beautiful Morcell from the Minister.

Worth Gold.

It is the best elucidation of the Character of the K.  of Prussia that I have ever seen.



Louisa I wish you were here to dance to night—

I dont wish for your Aunt because One such Evening would kill her.

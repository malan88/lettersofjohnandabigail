Quincy Novbr 7 10th 1794



my dearest Friend



I hope you are agreably lodgd and that your Company will be to your mind.

I rejoice in the ReElection of mr Ames, and mr Smith of Carolina.

tis Said mr Freeman is chosen for Barnstable a clasmate of our Son JQA, a Lawyer, a worthy Sensible Man as I have heard.

for this district mr Reed I hear is chosen.

I do not however approve of Clergymen becomeing politicians.

you may mak a Chaplin of him.

I hear however that he is an ingenious Sensible Man.

mr Dexter tis thought is not yet chosen, oweing to their being several persons voted for.

a large number of votes for mr Gerry who did not wish to be considerd as a candidate and whose influence will be given to mr Dexter should a second vote be necessary.



I have read mr Munroe speach in the National assembly!!!

Charmed with the stability of their counsels!

what a consience.

the



Translater may be in fault.

every minister could not have made Such a speach.



You wish to know how the Business proceeds—

Savil Nightingal & Bracket have been constantly carting sea weed.

they have brought sufficient to compleatly cover the orchard.

it is not yet all spread oweing, to the potato which has taken of Some of the Hands, and will take they tell me, two days more to compleat.

I inclose you a journal of the Buisness of every day since you left me.

I set out tomorrow for Haverhill, leaving the weeks buisness agreed upon with Shaw.

I hope to return on fryday, and by saturdays post to hear from you.

do not let Brisler omit my flower.

it has risen here to 52 shillings Remember me to all inquiring Friends Thomas thought mr Brisler had best send round his Bed & what things he left.

I forgot to mention it to him.

he will judge whether it is best to send them now or in the Spring



Your ever affectionate



A Adams

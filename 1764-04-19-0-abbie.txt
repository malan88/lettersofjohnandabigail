Thursday Eve.  Weymouth April th 19 1764



Why my good Man, thou hast the curiosity of a Girl.

Who could have believed that only a slight hint would have set thy imagination a gig in such a manner.

And a fine encouragement I have to unravel the Mistery as thou callest it.

Nothing less truly than to be told Something to my disadvantage.

What an excellent reward that will be?

In what Court of justice did’st thou learn that equity?

I thank thee Friend such knowledg as that is easy eno’ to be obtained without paying for it.

As to the insinuation, it doth not give me any uneasiness, for if it is any thing very bad, I know thou dost not believe it.

I am not conscious of any harm that I have done, or wished to any Mortal.

I bear no Malice to any Being.

To my Enimies, (if any I have) I am willing to afford assistance; therefore towards Man, I maintain a Conscience void of offence.



Yet by this I mean not that I am faultless, but tell me what is the Reason that persons had rather acknowledg themselves guilty, than be accused by others.

Is it because they are more tender of themselves, or because they meet with more favor from others, when they ingenuously confess.

Let that be as it will there is something which makes it more agreeable to condemn ourselves than to be condemned by others.



But altho it is vastly disagreeable to be accused of faults, yet no person ought to be offended when such accusations are deliverd in the Spirit of Friendship.

I now call upon you to fullfill your promise, and tell me all my faults, both of omission and commission, and all the Evil you either know, or think of me, be to me a second conscience, nor put me off to a more convenient Season.

There can be no time more proper than the present, it will be harder to erase them when habit has strengthned and confirmd them.



Do not think I triffle.

These are really meant as words of Truth and Soberness—for the present good Night.

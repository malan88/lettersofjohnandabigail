Littlefields at Wells.  July 3.  1774



My Dear



Mr.  Winthrop, Mr.  Quincy and I came this Morning from York, before Breakfast, 15 Miles, in order to hear my learned Friend Hemmenway.

Mr.  Quincy brought me a Letter from Williams, in which he lets me know that you and the Family were well.

This is very refreshing News.

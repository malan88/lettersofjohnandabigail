    "How will make but a pitifull Figure.",
    "The Militia of four States, are turning out, with much Alacrity, and chearfull Spirits.",
    "The Continental Army, under Washington, Sullivan and Nash, besides is in my Opinion more numerous, by several Thousands, than Howes whole Force.",
    "I am afraid that He will be frightened and run on board his ships and go away, plundering, to some other Place.",
    "I almost wish he had Philadelphia, for then he could not get away.",
    "I really think it would be the best Policy to retreat before him, and let him into this Snare, where his Army must be ruined.",
    "However this Policy will not be adopted.",
    "In a Letter from good Authority, Mr.",
    "Paca, we are informed that many dead Horses have been driven on the Eastern shore of Maryland.",

    "The Business of the Continent has been in so critical and dangerous a situation for the last 12 Months, that it was necessary the Massachusetts should have a full Representation, but the Expences of living are grown so enormous, that I believe it will be necessary to",
    "reduce the Number of Delegates to three after this Campaign is over."

My dear Portia

There is a great deal of hatred against the Govt. in England as you will see by the song inclosed. They are going on, with County meetings, Petitions, Committees, Correspondences, Associations &c. in our mode. What it will come to, I dont know.

They talk in London about withdrawing the Troops, &c., but I suspect, We had better take em, least they should alter their minds.

At last a Vessell has arrived at Bourdeaux from Baltimore, brings two or three newspapers, as late as 17 feb. but no Letters.—You have had a hard Winter, but I hope you had a good fire. I had a harder, without any fire, in Spain.

I am so taken up, with writing to Phil[adelphia] that I dont write to you so often as I wish. I hope you wont complain of me this time for not writing often enough, and long enough whatever may be the worth of it.

I hope you will advertise me, if there are any Machinations going forward. All well.

Adieu.

My dearest Friend



On Tuesday Mr T.

B.

Adams left Us, at Eleven in the stage for New York & Boston and consequently Quincy.

I should have been glad to have held him till I could carry him with me: but I thought it my Duty to comply with his desire, both for his sake and yours.

He Seems determined to settle in Phyladelphia.

He would have a happier Life, and be a more important Man in Quincy: But I must do & say as My Father did to me: leave him to his own Inclination and acquiesce in it as a dispensation of Providence.

You will find him very agreable and pleasant.



By the time he returns, I expect the Plague will drive him out, again.

It is undoubtedly here lurking about the City all this Winter.

Tazewell did not die of it: but I suppose of an Appoplexie tho they call it a Pleurisie.



We had Yesterday a large Company: C.

J.

McKean and the Judges & Lawyers of Pensylvania with some Members of Congress: all very agreable.

I am reading the K.

of Prussias Correspondence with Voltaire D’Alembert &c He is forever talking of his Age Infirmities, Decline & Decay.

His Memory is going.

His Imagination is gone—

His Teeth fail—

His Limbs are stiff & goutty—

He is broken—

He is old—

&c &c &c—

Yet at last When he was really old and broken he could not bear to hear of it.



His Phylosophy was bad enough: tho not so bad is that of others then & since.

His Wit is to me a little dull—

His humour



heavy—There is an Affectation of Gaiety, which however does not make the Reader very gay.

Frank waits for my Lettr.

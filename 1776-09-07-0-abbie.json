    "Last monday I left the Town of Boston, underwent the operation of a smoaking at the lines and arrived at my Brother Cranchs where we go for purification; there I tarried till wedensday, and then came Home, which seem\u2019d greatly endeard to me by my long absence.",
    "I think I never felt greater pleasure at comeing Home after an absence in my Life.  Yet I felt a vacuum in my Breast and sent a Sigh to P[hiladelphi]a.",

    "Charlly is Banished yet, I keep him at his Aunt Cranch\u2019s out of the way of those who have not had the Distemper, his Arm has many Scabs upon it which are yet very soar.",
    "He is very weak and sweats a nights prodigiously.  I am now giving him the Bark.  He recoverd very fast considering how ill he was.",
    "I pitty your anxiety and feel sorry that I wrote you when he was so Bad, but I knew not how it might turn with Him, had it been otherways than well, it might have proved a greater Shock than to have known that he was ill.",

    "It took its rise among the Tories who as Swift said of himself \u201cBy their fears betray their Hopes\u201d but How they should ever take it into their Heads that you was poisond at New York a fortnight before that we heard any thing of that villans Zedwitz plan of poisoning the",
    "waters of the City, I cannot tell.",

    "But if we should be defeated I think we shall not be conquered.",
    "A people fired like the Romans with Love of their Country and of Liberty, a zeal for the publick Good, and a Noble Emulation of Glory, will not be disheartned or dispirited by a Succession of unfortunate Events.",
    "But like them may we learn by Defeat the power of becomeing invincible.",

    "The Scarcity of the article made me ask her Where she got it.",
    "She replied her Sweet Heart sent it to her by Mr.  Gerry.",

    "A Little after you mention\u2019d a couple of Bundles sent.",
    "I supposed one of them might contain the article but found they were Letters.",
    "How Mr.  Gerry should make such a mistake I know not.",
    "I shall take the Liberty of sending for what is left of it tho I suppose it is half gone as it was very freely used.",
    "If you had mentiond a single Word of it in your Letter I should have immediately found out the mistake.",
    "Tis said that the Efforts of our Enemies will be to stop the communication between the colonies by taking possession of Hudsons Bay.",

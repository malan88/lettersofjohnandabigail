April 30. 1777

We have a fine Piece of News this Morning of the March of 2000 of the Enemy, and destroying a fine Magazine thereâ€”and the stupid sordid cowardly torified Country People let them pass without Opposition.

All New England is petrified, with Astonishment, Horror, and Despair, I believe in my Conscience. They behave worse than any Part of the Continent. Even in N. Jersy 2000 Men could not have marched so far.

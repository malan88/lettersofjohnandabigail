My dearest Friend



Your favours of 18th.

and 19th instant are so full of your Plans and Labours in Agriculture, that I begin to be jealous you will acquire a Reputation as a Farmer that will quite eclypse my own.



I rejoice at length that all Tenants are dispossessed and that Land stock and Utensils are now at our own Disposal.

I am glad you have bought a Yoke of oxen and hope you will buy a farm horse.



Our Thomas is fitted off with Horses saddle Bridle and Saddle Bags and on Monday last sett off upon the Circuit with Mr Ingersolâ€”

He will be absent Six Weeks.

He goes to Chester Lancaster York Carlisle &c



Mr Trumbull our Friend the Painter goes with Mr Jay as his private Secretary.



I send you an illiberal Party Pamphlet or two and am tenderly



John Adams



Has Mr Cranch opend his Post office?

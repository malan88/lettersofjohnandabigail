Philadelphia April 30. 1794

My dearest Friend

Your favours of 18th. and 19th instant are so full of your Plans and Labours in Agriculture, that I begin to be jealous you will acquire a Reputation as a Farmer that will quite eclypse my own.

I rejoice at length that all Tenants are dispossessed and that Land stock and Utensils are now at our own Disposal.— I am glad you have bought a Yoke of oxen and hope you will buy a farm horse.

Our Thomas is fitted off with Horses saddle Bridle and Saddle Bags and on Monday last sett off upon the Circuit with Mr Ingersol— He will be absent Six Weeks. He goes to Chester Lancaster York Carlisle &c

Mr Trumbull our Friend the Painter goes with Mr Jay as his private Secretary.

I send you an illiberal Party Pamphlet or two and am tenderly

John Adams

Has Mr Cranch opend his Post office?

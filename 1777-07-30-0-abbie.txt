I dare say before this Time you have interpreted the Northern Storm; if the presages chill’d your Blood, how must you be froze and stiffend at the Disgrace brought upon our Arms unless some warmer passion seaze you, and Anger and resentment Fire your Breast.



How are all our vast Magazines of Cannon, powder, Arms, cloathing, provision, Medicine &c.

to be restored to us—but what is vastly more, How shall the Disgrace be wiped away?

How shall our lost Honour be retreaved?

The reports with regard to that fortress are very vague and uncertain.

Some write from thence, that there was not force sufficent to defend it, others say it might have stood a long Siege.

Some there are who ought to know why and wherefore we have given away a place of such importance.



That the inquiry will be made I make no doubt, and if Cowardice, Guilt, Deceit, are found upon any one How high or exalted soever his station, may shame, reproach, infamy, hatred, and the execrations of the publick be his portion.



I would not be so narrow minded as to suppose that there are not many Men of all Nations possessd of Honour, Virtue and Integrety; yet tis to be lamented that we have not Men among ourselves sufficently qualified for War to take upon them the most important command.



It was customary among the Carthaginians to have a Military School, in which the flower of their Nobility and those whose talants and ambition prompted them to aspire to the first dignities, learnt the art of War.

From among these they selected all their general officers, for tho they employd mercenary Soldiers, they were too jealous and suspicious to employ foreign Generals.



Will a Foreigner whose Interest is not naturally connected with ours, (any otherways than as the cause of Liberty is the cause of all mankind), will he act with the same Zeal or expose himself to eaquel dangers with the same resolution for a Republick of which he is not a member as He would have done for his own Native Country?

And can the people repose an eaquel confidence in them, even supposing them Men of integrety and abilities, and that they meet with success eaquel to their abilities.

How much envy and Malice, is employd against them; and How galling to pride, How mortifying to Humane Nature to see itself excelld.

    "[From: John]",
    "Philadelphia August 20th.  1777 Wednesday",
    "My best Friend",
    "This Day compleats three Years since I stepped into the Coach, at Mr.  Cushings Door, in Boston, to go to Philadelphia in Quest of Adventures.",
    "And Adventures I have found.",
    "I feel an Inclination sometimes, to write the History of the last Three Years, in Imitation of Thucidides.",
    "There is a striking Resemblance, in several Particulars, between the Peloponnesian and the American War.",
    "The real Motive to the former was a Jealousy of the growing Power of Athens, by Sea and Land.",
    "The genuine Motive to the latter, was a similar Jealousy of the growing Power of America.",
    "The true Causes which incite to War, are seldom professed, or Acknowledged.",
    "We are now afloat upon a full Sea: When We shall arrive at a safe Harbour, no Mariner has Skill and experience enough to foretell.",
    "But, by the Favour of Heaven, We shall make a prosperous Voyage, after all the Storms, and Shoals are passed."

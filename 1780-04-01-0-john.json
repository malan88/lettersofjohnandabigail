It was a public day.  There was a great deal of Company, and I had opportunity only to take a cursory view.  The whole is very curious.", "There is an handsome statue of Mr.  Buffon, the great natural Historian whose Works you have, whose labours have given fame to this Cabinet and Garden.", "When shall We have in America, such Collections?", "The Collection of American Curiosities that I saw at Norwalk in Connecticutt made by Mr.  Arnold, which he afterwards to my great mortification sold to Gov.  Tryon, convinces me, that our Country affords as ample materials, for Collections of this nature as any part of", "the World.", "Five midshipmen of the Alliance, came here last night, Marston, Hogan, Fitzgerald and two others, from Norway, where they were sent with Prizes, which the Court of Denmark were absurd and unjust enough, to restore to the English.", "They however treated the Officers and People well, and defrayed their Expences.", "They say the Norwegians were very angry, with the Court of Copenhagen, for delivering up these Vessells.", "It was the Blunder of Ignorance, I believe, rather than any ill Will.", "Every day when I ride out, without any particular Business to do, or Visit to make, I order my servant to carry me to some place where I never was before, so that at last I believe I have seen all Paris, and all the fields and scenes about it, that are near it.", "It is very pleasant.", "Charles is as well beloved here as at home.

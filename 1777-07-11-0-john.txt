Philadelphia July 11.

1777



This Letter will go by the Hand of the Honourable Samuel Hewes Esqr., one of the Delegates in Congress from North Carolina, from the Month of September 1774, untill 1777.



I had the Honour to serve with him upon the naval Committee, who laid the first Foundations, the Corner Stone of an American navy, by fitting to Sea the Alfred, Columbus, Cabott, Andrew Doria, Providence, and several others.

An Honour, that I make it a Rule to boast of, upon all Occasions, and I hope my Posterity will have Reason to boast.

Hewes has a sharp Eye and keen, penetrating Sense, but what is of much more Value is a Man of Honour and Integrity.

If he should call upon you, and you should be about, I hope you will treat him with all the Complaisance that is due to his Character.

I almost envy him his Journey, altho he travells for his Health, which at present is infirm.

I am yours, yours, yours,



John Adams

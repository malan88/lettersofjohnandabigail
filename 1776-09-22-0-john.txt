22 Sept.

1776





We have at last agreed upon a Plan, for forming a regular Army.

We have offered 20 dollars, and 100 Acres of Land to every Man, who will inlist, during the War.

And a new sett of Articles of War are agreed on.

I will send you, if I can a Copy of these Resolutions and Regulations.



I am at a Loss what to write.

News We have not.

Congress seems to be forgotten by the Armies.

We are most unfaithfully served in the Post Office, as well as many other Offices, civil and military.



Unfaithfullness in public Stations, is deeply criminal.

But there is no Encouragement to be faithfull.

Neither Profit, nor Honour, nor Applause is acquired by faithfullness.

But I know by what.

There is too much Corruption, even in this infant Age of our Republic.

Virtue is not in Fashion.

Vice is not infamous.

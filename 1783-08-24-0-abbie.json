    "By Capt.  Freeman who Sails on Sunday for England I embrace the opportunity of writing you a few lines.",
    "Mr.  Goreham is gone to Portsmouth to embark from thence, impowerd by the Town of Charlstown to solicit Charity for them.",
    "I have not the best opinion of his errant; nor of his politeness, or I should have Supposed that as he means to apply to you for assistance; he would have <Supposed> imagined that a Letter from your family would not have been unacceptable, but he moved off, without",
    "giving me any notice.",
    "I do not regret it much as Capt.  Freeman will be so kind as to take this, and carefully forward it.",
    "I have written frequently, written by way of England Since the Peace, and hope you have received my Letters.",
    "I have not heard so frequently from you as I wish; your last date was the 30 of May.",
    "I hope it was not long after that date, that you remaind in the dissagreable suspence which you then appeard to be in, and that your publick dispatches were agreable to your mind and that you will not be delayed by them.",

    "When I reflect upon the many perplexing scenes, and difficulties through which you have passt in the last ten years, I conceive them sufficient, to batter down a stronger building than the Fabrick you occupy.",
    "It is however a pleasing consolation that the Deity which inhabits it, is formed for a duration, beyond the brittle tennament, and is capable of extending its views to an existance more suitable to its nature and capacity\u2014and where I trust it will meet with a due regard",
    "for that Benevolence and good will which upon all occasions, has been exerted for the benifit of Mankind.",

    "I think she enjoys better health than she did a Year ago.",
    "I am going with Genll.  Warrens family, and a small party of Friends to dine with my Father.",
    "How happy would it make the good old gentleman could you be one of the party; alass the Sons his Daughters have given him, are those only in which he can rejoice.",
    "How often have I heard him both with pain and pleasure, say, when reflecting upon his misfortune, I desire to bless God, I have three comforts to one affliction\u2014and he might have added four, for his Daughter in Law is to him, like an own child in kindness and attention,",
    "to be otherways she must be a monster of ingratitude for to her he has supplied the place of Father Mother and husband.",
    "There are Six fine children as you would wish to see\u2014all without a Father, or what is worse.",
    "My little Neice who has lived 6 years with me is a sweet Girl, tho she is no Stranger to her unhappy lot.",
    "She never speaks a word upon the Subject, all that she ever said was the other day, a stranger had askd who she was.",

    "Hope and Fear have been the two ruling passions of a large portion of my Life, and I have been banded from one to the other like a tennis Ball.",
    "We are waiting with a degree of impatience for the definitive Treaty.",
    "There is nothing New in the political World\u2014cheating is an old story, even from the Days of Jacob.",

    "all your Friends rejoiced in the fine weather which attended you, and conceive it, a propitious omen.",
    "I enjoyed, the Triumph tho I did not partake the \u2019Gale, and perhaps my mind might have been a little Elated upon the Late occasion if I had not have lived Long enough in the world to have seen the fickleness of it, yet to give it, its due, it blew from the right point",
    "on that day.",
    "Mr Allen was so polite as to come out to Braintree to day to know if I had any Letters or package that I wish\u2019d to send forward to you, & that he would take them.",
    "I pomis\u2019d to forward a Letter & News papers.",
    "mr A.  I presume has buisness of importance by his return so soon.",

    "I received a Letter from him this Evening.",
    "I will inclose it by an other opportunity, yet I promisd to mention to you what I conceived almost, or quite needless, because I knew your sentiments with respect to him so well, that I was sure you would interest yourself for his continuance in office whatever the",

    "he seems to be fond of the thought of getting rid of the parade of commencment.",
    "if it would be no injury to him, I should be equally fond of getting rid of a trouble in which there is very little Satisfaction, a good deal of expence & generally many affronts given by omissions",

    "the Horns were hollow upon inspection but I suppose your Farm is quite out of your head by this Time & you will only think of it as a departed Friend, & without the consolation of thinking its situation better\u2019d, the 20 Trees are all set out, & came in good order.",

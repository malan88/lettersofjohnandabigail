I must wait to know whether Congress will do any Thing or not to furnish my Houseâ€”

if they do not I will have no House before next Fall.

and then a very moderate one, with very moderate Furniture.



The Prisoners from Algiers arrived Yesterday in this City, in good health and looking very well.

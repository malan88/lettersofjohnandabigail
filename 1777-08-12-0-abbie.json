    "A few lines by way of remembrance every week tho I have nothing new to write you if I may judge you by myself are very acceptable.",
    "I long for a wedensday which to me is the happiest day of the week.",
    "I never fail of a pacquet, tis soon read, and then the next wedensday is thought of with the same Solisitude\u2014",
    "\u201cMan never is but always to be blest.\u201d",
    "The last post brought me yours of july 16, 18 and 20th.",
    "You have often of late mentiond a daughter with much tenderness and affection, but before this time you must know of our Bereavement.",
    "I felt it last Sunday with all its poignancy.  It was the first time of my going out.",
    "Your Brother held up a daughter and call\u2019d it by the Name of Susana.",
    "I wishd to have call\u2019d ours had it lived after my own dear Mother, and was much gratified by your mentioning it and requesting it.",
    "But tis now of no importance either the Name or the Relation.",
    "Do you feel in your own Breast any Sentiments of tenderness for one you never knew, for one who could scarcly be said ever to have had an existance?",
    "The loss occasions very different Sensation[s] from those I once before experienced, but still I found I had a tenderness and an affection greater than I immagined could have possess\u2019d my Heart for one who was not endeard to me by its smiles and its graces.",
    "But the Parent is dear to me, dear to me beyond the power of words to discribe.",

    "Nay even the sight of a Garment (worn) belonging to him will raise a mixture both of pleasure and pain in my Bosome.",
    "Can it then be strange that I should feel a fondness and a tender affection for a pledg of unabated Love, a Love pure as the Gold without alloy\u2014",
    "\u201cI Glory in the sacred ties\nWhich Modern Wits and fools dispise\nOf Husband and of Wife.\u201d"

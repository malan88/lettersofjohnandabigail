    "Saturday afternoon Boston Octobr.  13.  1764",
    "When I wrote you by the Doctor I was in hopes that I should have been out the next day, but my disorder did not leave me as I expected and I am still confind extreemly weak, and I believe low spirited.",
    "The Doctor encourages me, tells me I shall be better in a few days.",
    "I hope to find his words true, but at present I feel, I dont know how, hardly myself.",
    "I would not have the Cart come a tuesday but should be extreemly glad to see you a Monday.",
    "Yours,\nA Smith"

I was greatly rejoiced at the return of your servant to find you had safely arrived, and that you were well.

I had never heard a word from you after you left New york, and a most ridiciolous story had been industerously propagated in this and the neighbouring Towns to injure the cause and blast your Reputation, viz.  that you and your President had gone on board a Man of War from N–y and saild for England.

I should not mention so idle a report, but that it had given uneasiness to some of your Friends, not that they in the least credited the report, but because the Gaping vulgar swallowed the story.

One man had deserted them and proved a traitor, an other might &c.

I assure you such high Disputes took place in the publick house of this parish, that some men were collerd and draged out of the shop, with great Threats for reporting such scandelous lies, and an unkle of ours offerd his life as a forfeit for you if the report proved true.



However it has been a nine days marvel and will now cease.

I heartily wish every Tory was Extirpated [from] America, they are continually by secret means undermineing and injuring our cause.



I am charmed with the Sentiments of Common Sense; and wonder how an honest Heart, one who wishes the welfare of their country, and the happiness of posterity can hesitate one moment at adopting them; I want to know how those Sentiments are received in Congress?

I dare say their would be no difficulty in procuring a vote and instructions from all the Assemblies in New England for independancy.

I most sincerely wish that now in the Lucky Minuet it might be done.



I have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and expectation ever since you left me.

It has been said to morrow and to morrow for this month, but when the dreadfull to morrow will be I know not—but hark!  the House this instant shakes with the roar of Cannon.

I have been to the door and find tis a cannonade from our Army, orders I find are come for all the remaining Militia to repair to the Lines a monday night by twelve o clock.

No Sleep for me to Night; and if I cannot who have no guilt upon my Soul with regard to this Cause, how shall the misirible wretches who have been the procurers of this Dreadfull Scene and those who are to be the actors, lie down with the load of Guilt upon their Souls.

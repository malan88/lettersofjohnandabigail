Passy Jany. 19. 1779

My dearest

I can only tell you that I am not well. A bad Cold only. The others are all well.

Not a Word of News from any Part. None from America a long time, i.e. since Mr. Cheever and Sears sailed. None from Congress this Age. Mr. Gridley, Cheever and Sears, brought me only a Line from your Uncle and a Duplicate from Mr. Cushing. These I answered before.

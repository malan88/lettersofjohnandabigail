My dearest Friend

I am in such a situation that I cannot see the way clear for you to come on, till some resolution is passed in the House.— You will be as ready as you can, and I will write you the Moment to come on. any Thing is done.— I will resign my office rather than bring you here to be miserable.

Yours eternally

John Adams.

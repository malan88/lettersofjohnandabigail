Falmouth July 5.

1774



My Dr.



I cant be easy without my Pen in my Hand, yet I know not what to write.



I have this Morning heard a Dialogue between Will.

Gardiner and a Captain Pote of Falmouth.

Gardiner says he cant subscribe the Non Consumption Agreement, because he has 100 Men coming from England to settle upon Kennebeck River, and he must supply them, which he cant do without English Goods.

That Agreement he says may do, at Boston, but not in the Eastern Country.

Pote said he never would sign it, and rail’d away at Boston Mobs, drowning Tea, and tarring Malcom.



James Sullivan at Dinner told us a Story or two.

One Member of the General Court he said as they came down Stairs after their Dissolution at Salem, said to him “Tho we are kill’d we died scrabbling, did not We.”—This is not very witty I think.



Another Story was of a Piece of Wit of Brother Porter of Salem.

He came upon the Floor and asked a Member “What State are you in now?” The Member answered “in a State of Nature.”—Ay says Porter, “and you will be d—

d before you will get into a State of Grace.”

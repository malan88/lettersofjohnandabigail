My Dearest Friend



With a great deal of snow upon the Ground it is now plentifully snowing.

There must be an unusual Quantity upon the Earth.

I suppose you have it very deep.



our Men and Teams must have had a terrible Jobb to get the Lumber home: but I hope it is all compleated eâ€™er this.



To Day at two Dr Ewing & Mr snowden are to dine with me and tomorrow at four about 30 senators and Reps.

I have not had as yet any Tuesdays or Saturdays Parties: and I believe I will not have any.

There is too much familiarity at them: they Sit too late.



The last Letter from you was dated the 9th.

I admire your taste for Weddings.

I hope you will marry Louisa & Betcy Howard and all the single ones, who are ripe.

I am sorry for Louisa at Berlin: But I have Grand Children more than enough.

I dont want any more.

Yet I should like that John should have a son & a Daughter.

But I cannot bear the trouble of Children at my Age.



In short I have enough of Children as well as Grand Children.

My Daughter and one son, will bring down my Grey Hairs with sorrow to the Grave, if I dont arrouse all my Phylosophy.

The Daughter too without a fault.

Unfortunate Daughter!

Unhappy Child!



I begin to doubt whether I was in the Way of my Duty in ever engaging in public Life.

With my Family of Children ought I not to have staid at home, minded their Education and sought their Advancement in Life!

It is too late for this Casuistry now.

The Die is cast and I am not far from the End of my Life.

I have done all for my Children that I could: and meant all for the best.

What have I not suffered?

What have I ever enjoyed?

All my Enjoyments have been upon my farm.

Oh that my Children and Grand Children were all Farmers!



I am anxious and impatient to hear of the Arrival of Thomas.



Is Master Cleverly dead?

And Mr Burrell?

How is Mr Cranch and Boylston Adams?

Ap.  8.  1777





Yours of 26 March came by this days Post.  Am happy to hear you have received so many Letters from me.

You need not fear Writing in your cautious Way by the Post, which is now well regulated.

But if your Letters should be intercepted, they would do no Harm.

Lee fares as well as a Man in close Prison, can fare, I suppose, constantly guarded and watched.

I fancy, Howe will engage that he shall be treated as a Prisoner of War, and in that Case, We shall all be easy.

For my own Part, I dont think the Cause depends upon him.

I am sorry to see such wild Panegyricks in your Newspapers.

I wish they would consider the Woes against Idolatry.

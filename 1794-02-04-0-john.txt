My dearest Friend



The Indisposition of my ever honoured and beloved Mother gives me a very tender Anxiety—

I hope she may yet get the better of her Disorder and enjoy a good share of Health—

remember me to her in the most affectionate and dutiful manner



You ask me if I wish to give any Directions.

I pray you not to let the good old Lady know that you have asked or I answered such a



Question.

But if the Melancholly Event should unhappily take Place, I desire to be at the whole Expence of a decent Funeral and pray My Brother to accept of all Claims from me of any share in whatever may be left.

But if Health should be restored I pray you to burn this Letter and say not a Word of it to any one.



yours



John Adams

Phil. Feb. 2. 1797

My dearest Friend

I believe I have not directly & expressly Answered your Letter, inclosing the Memorandum from Mr Smith of the Price of a Chariot at Boston.

I had before bespoke a new Chariot here, and it is or will be ready: so that there is an End of all further Enquiries about Carriages.— I hope as soon as the Point is legally settled you will have your Coach new Painted and all the Arms totally obliterated. It would be a folly to excite popular feelings and vulgar Insolence for nothing.

Mrs Washington, Mrs Powell &c send their regards &c

I believe I must take Mr Malcom, Charles’s Clerk & Pupil for a private secretary, at least for a time.

I wish you could get a compleat set of Domesticks from your Neighbourhood that We might avoid a little of the Brigandage.

Fine Weather to day. Candlemas. Half your corn and half your hay.

I am Affectionately

J. A

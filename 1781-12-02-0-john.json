    "I thought he would go directly home, in a short Passage, in the best Opportunity which would probably ever present.",

    "They will never hurt your Husband, whose Character is fortified with a shield of Innocence and Honour ten thousandfold stronger than brass or Iron.",
    "The contemptible Essays made by you know whom, will only tend to their own Confusion.",
    "My Letters have shewn them their own Ignorance <and Folly>, a sight they could not bear.",
    "Say as little about it as I do.",
    "It has already brought them into the true system and that system is tryumphant.",
    "I laugh, and will laugh before all Posterity at their impotent <, despicable, ridiculous folly> Rage and Envy.",
    "They could not help blushing themselves if they were to review their Conduct.",
    "Dear Tom thy Letter does thee much honour.",
    "Thy Brother Charles shall teach thee french and Dutch, at home.",

    "They will be infected with the Examples and Habits and Taste for Expensive Living, without the means.",
    "He was not.",
    "My Children, shall never have the smallest soil of dishonour or disgrace brought upon them by their father, no not to please Ministers, Kings, or Nations.",
    "At the Expence of a little of this my Children might perhaps ride at their Ease through Life, but dearly as I love them they shall live in the service of their Country, in her Navy, her Army, or even out of either in the extreamest Degree of Poverty before I will depart",
    "in the smallest Iota from my Sentiments of Honour and Delicacy, for I, even I, have sentiments of Delicacy, as exquisite as the proudest Minister that ever served a Monarch.",
    "They may not be exactly like those of some Ministers.",
    "I beg you would excuse me to my dear Friends, to whom I cannot write so often as I wish.",
    "I have indispensible Duties which take up all my time, and require more than I have.",
    "General Washington has done me great Honour, and much public service by sending me, authentic Accounts of his own and Gen.  Greens last great Actions.",

I have hardly had occasion to feel at all anxious about them.", "L[incol]n is not appointed.  Ward is requested to continue.  I hope he will.", "I am much pleased with your Spirit, in resolving to procure me Horses your self and not to wait for a Method, which would be more round about and uncertain.", "I think I have a Right and that it is my duty, to take a little Respit and Relaxation.", "If my Life and Health is of any Use to the Public, it is necessary for the Public as well as for me, that I should take a little rest, in order to preserve them.", "If they are of none, it is no matter how much rest, I take."]

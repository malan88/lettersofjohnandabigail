My Dear



This Letter, I presume, will go by the brave and amiable General Washington.



Our Army will have a Group of Officers, equal to any service.

Washington, Ward, Lee, Gates, Gridley, together with all the other New England officers, will make a glorious Council of War.



This Congress are all as deep, as the Delegates from the Massachuchusetts, and the whole Continent as forward as Boston.



We shall have a Redress of Grievances, or an Assumption of all the Powers of Government legislative, Executive and judicial, throughout the whole Continent very soon.



Georgia is bestirring itselfâ€”I mean the whole of it.

The Parish of St.

Johns which is one third of it, was with Us before.



I am &c.

Phyladelphia Dec.  13.  1798 

My Dearest Friend



Your Letters of Nov.  29 Dec.  2.  and 3 affect me very tenderly.

The low Spirits, Effects of long and exhausting sickness are apparent: but these are Evils of a serious nature.

I pray you to banish as much as possible all gloomy Thoughts and be very cautious to avoid every thing which may endanger a return of your old Disorders.



To reconcile you to your fate I have a great mind to give you a detail of mine.

A Peck of Troubles in a large Bundle of Papers, often in a hand Writing almost illegible, comes every day from the office of   office of   offfice of   &c &c &c.

Thousands of sea Letters Medeterranean Passes and Commissions & Patents to sign—

No Company—

No society—

idle unmeaning Ceremony—

Family Vices, Follies, Extravagance, shiftlessness, and Health, sinking for what I knew under my Troubles & fatigues.



You and I, seem to have arrived prematurely at the Age when there is no pleasure.





All this is not the Resignation of Socrates.



I cannot encourage the Idea of your coming on to Phyladelphia.

The horrid Roads and cold damp Weather would put an End to you.



I hope our dear Thomas will arrive and chear you up.

I am with / unalterable affection
J.  A

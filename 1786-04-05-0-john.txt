Buckingham April 5. 1786

My dear

We have Seen Magnificence, Elegance and Taste enough to excite an Inclination to see more. We conclude to go to Birmingham, per­haps to the Leasowes, and in that Case shall not have the Pleasure to see you, till Sunday or Monday.

Love to my dear Nabby, and to Coll Smith. He will be so good as to give this account of Us, if any Questions are asked. Yours forever

John Adams

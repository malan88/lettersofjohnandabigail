Philadelphia Octr.

1776



I suppose your Ladyship has been in the Twitters, for some Time past, because you have not received a Letter by every Post, as you used to do.

But I am coming to make my Apology in Person.

I, Yesterday asked and obtained Leave of Absence.

It will take me till next Monday, to get ready, to finish off a few Remnants of public Business, and to put my private Affairs in proper Order.

On the 14th.

day of October, I shall get away, perhaps.

But I dont expect to reach Home, in less than a fortnight, perhaps not in three Weeks, as I shall be obliged to make stops by the Way.

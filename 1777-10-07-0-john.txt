York Town Octr.  7.  1777



I have no Time, nor Accommodations to write of lateâ€”besides I seldom know what to write, and when I do, I dont love to write it.



One Thing is now becoming more and more certain every day.

That is that our People will and do fight, and altho they make a clumsy Hand of it, yet they do better and better.



I am lodged in the House of General Roberdeau, an Israelite indeed, I believe, who, with his sisters and Children and servants, do every Thing to make Us happy.

We are highly favoured.

No other Delegates are so well off.



I am as well as usual.

Your Dream will never come to pass.

You never can be cooly received by me, while my Heart beats and my senses remain.

I had no Letter from you by the last Post.



Yours, yours, yours,



John Adams

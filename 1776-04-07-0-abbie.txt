April 7 1776





I Received two Letters from you this week one of the 13 and the other the 19 of March.

I know not where one of my Letters is gone, unless you have since Received it.

I certainly wrote you in Febry.  and the first Letter I wrote I mention that I had not wrote before.

I have write four Letters before this.

Believe I have Received all yours Except one you mention writing from Framingham which I never heard of before.



Have Received all the papers you sent, the oration and Magizines.

In the small papers I some times find peices begun and continued, (for instance Johnstones Speach) but am so unlucky as not to get the papers in order and miss of seeing the whole.

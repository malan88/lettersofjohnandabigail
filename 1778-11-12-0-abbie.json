    "[From: Abbie]",
    "[Braintree, 12\u201323 November 1778]",
    "I have taken up my pen again to relieve the anxiety of a Heart too susceptable for its own repose, nor can I help complaining to my Dearest Friend that his painfull absence is not as formerly alleiviated by the tender tokens of his Friendship, 3 very short Letters only",
    "have reachd my Hands during 9 months absence.",
    "I cannot be so unjust to his affection as to suppose he has not wrote much oftener and more perticularly, but must sit down to the Score of misfortune that so few have reachd me.",
    "I cannot charge myself with any deficiency in this perticular as I have never let an opportunity slip without writing to you since we parted, tho you make no mention of having received a line from me; if they are become of so little importance as not to be worth",
    "noticeing with your own Hand, be so kind as to direct your Secretary",
    "I will not finish the sentance, my Heart denies the justice of the acqusation, nor does it believe your affection in the least diminished by distance or absence, but my Soul is wounded at a Seperation from you, and my fortitude all dissolved in frailty and weakness.",
    "When I cast my <Eye> thoughts across the Atlantick and view the distance, the dangers and Hazards which you have already passd through, and to which you must probably be again exposed, e\u2019er we shall meet, the Time of your absence unlimitted, all all conspire to cast a",
    "Gloom over my solitary hours, and bereave me of all domestick felicity.",
    "In vain do I strive to through of [throw off] in the company of my Friends some of the anxiety of my Heart, it increases in proportion to my endeavours to conceal it; the only alleiviation I know of would be a frequent intercourse by Letters unrestrained by the",
    "apprehension of their becomeing food for our Enemies.",
    "The affection I feel for my Friend is of the tenderest kind, matured by years, [sanctified?] by choise and approved by Heaven.",
    "Angles can witness to its purity, what care I then for the Ridicule of Britains should this testimony of it fall into their Hands, nor can I endure that so much caution and circumspection on your part should deprive me of the only consolor of your absence\u2014a consolation",
    "that our Enemies enjoy in a much higher degree than I do, Many of them having received 3 or 4 Letters from their Friend[s] in England to one that I have received from France."

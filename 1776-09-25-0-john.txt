I have only Time to say, by Mr.  Taylor, that I am not worse than I have been—that however, I think, the G[eneral] C[our]t might have sent somebody here, before now—and that it will not be many days before I shall sett off.

I shall wait for the Completion of a few Things and then go—perhaps in a Week or ten days.

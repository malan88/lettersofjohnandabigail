Dr. Miss Jemima

I have taken the best Advice, on the subject of your Billet, and I find you cannot compell me to pay unless I refuse Marriage; which I never did, and never will, but on the Contrary am ready to have you at any Time.

Yours,

Jonathan

I hope Jemima’s Conscience has as good a Memory as mine.
